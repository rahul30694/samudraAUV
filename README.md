<b>Introduction</b>

SAMUDRA ( <i>System for Autonomous Marine Underwater Detection and Research Activities</i> ) is an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) developed by a team of undergraduate
students from AIACTR to compete in the AUVSI Foundation by winning the NIOT’s SAVe-2016
Competition.
SAMUDRA is based on the principle low cost and high efficiency. SAMUDRA is designed for deep sea
exploration, navigation at very high speed and accuracy. The vehicle has six thrusters design which
enhances its maneuverability. The softwares we are working on are all open source. The embedded
processor system allows us the flexibility to have very high speed algorithms at low power
consumption. Also the system is equipped with vision with on board image processing in OpenCV and
also the system is capable to perform the path detection, obstacle avoidance and target identification
activities. The vehicle will also be equipped with acoustic system which can accurately identify and
enhance the acoustic signal received underwater and process it. For the navigation, it will be equipped
with Sparton AHRS-8. The whole system has been divided into mechanical,
electronics, programming and computer vision. The other sensors onboard include current sensor,
voltage sensor and pressure sensor etc.

<b>Highlights of the project</b>

• We bagged first prize in 5th International Exhibition and Conference GRIDTECH 2015,
POWERGRID with the support of Ministry of Power and in association with CBIP and IEEMA from 8th
to 10th April 2015 at ITPO, Pragati Maidan, New Delhi on new technologies in Transmission, Distribution
etc. over there by presenting a working model of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle which was displayed
in detection of faults in the underwater transmission links.
